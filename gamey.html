    <p>
        As Tazarin begins consuming the power within your soul, you find a weakness in Tazarin's mind that may just let you escape. The only comprehension that your mind can handle as you're merged with Tazarin is a dark maze with only one exit and one correct path. The maze is dark, filled with a blue fog that impairs your vision. The creation of the maze is different with every attempt to escape Tazarin's grasp as your mind fights against his.
